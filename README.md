============

This is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)-based build to create awesome presentations using [hovercraft](https://regebro.github.io/hovercraft/) and [impress.js](https://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/).

It comes with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) support because you can use it as a regular css file, or create some mix-ins, who might be really useful in presentations.


HOW TO USE IT
---------------

0. Install dependencies (sudo apt-get install python python-pip nodejs; sudo pip install hovercraft)
1. Clone it
2. npm install
3. gulp
4. gulp serve
5. Create an awesome presentation with a tight feedback loop thanks to a CTRL + S based workflow.


What can I build with this?
-----------------------------

See the [impress.js gallery](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/wiki/Examples-and-demos) for inspiration!
